# Getting started (ZenGin - Gothic 1 & 2)
To get started, you will need Gothic MDK (Mod development kit). MDK contains scripts, engine documentation, tutorials and tools to help you create your own modifications.

# MDK Contents
The MDK contains a lot of things, let's see whats's inside.
## Scripts
Arguably the most important part of the MDK are the original scripts. ZenGin's scripting language is called **Daedalus** and the scripts use `.d` file extension. Most of the functionality in the game is run by these scripts, from human and monster AI, to the routines of NPC, when do they go to bed, when (and where) do they pee, what items should NPCs have in their inventory, how much damage or how valuable an item should be. Of course some things are hard coded in the engine, but there are ways to alter their behaviour, we will discuss that in a later article.
