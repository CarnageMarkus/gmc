# Scripts

ZenGin uses its own scripting language called Daedalus. It is similar to C programming language, so if you know some C programming, it will be quite easy to ge started.

The `Scripts` directory is where the scripts live. You will be able to find Daedalus script files - `.d` extension and `.src` files, that list all of the files to be compiled.
