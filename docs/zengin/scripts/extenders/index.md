# Daedalus extenders
The default scripting language Daedalus can be quite limitng. Over the years the community created quite a few extenders to, well, extend the functinality. Before Union came algong, the standard to interface with the engine was the script library [Ikarus](ikarus/index.md) and a callection of packages [LeGo](lego/index.md) built on top of that. Not so recently an additional script packat was made (and is actively being worked on) [AF Script Packet](afsp/index.md) that offers even more functionality and is built on tom of Ikarus & LeGo.  
With the adoption of Union and plugins the Union system can use a new extender emerged called [zParserExtender](../../scripts/extenders/zPArserExtender). Other Union plugins can, of course, implement their own external functions.
