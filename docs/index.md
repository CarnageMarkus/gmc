# Welcome to Gothic Modding Community page

This GitHub page is designed to contains community maintained set of articles, tutorials and documentation for everything Gothic.

First two Gothic games use the engine called ZenGin developed by Pranha Bytes and Mad Scientists. If you want to know more about the history of the development, there is a heap of information on the [Gothic Archive](https://gothicarchive.org/).

The content here is not meant to be taken as the holy word of modding. We are just modders sharing our experiences, knowledge and our favorite workflows.

Feel free to open a pull request with your article, or propose changes.
